# BitVector and BitVectorSet
Two class libraries in order to work with BitVectors (aka BitSets): the "raw" BitVector class and the ISet abstraction: BitVectorSet.

## Usage
Derive from ``BitVectorSetFactory`` and create your custom ``factory`` class: than it is possible to create to custom ``BitVectorSet`` objects.
